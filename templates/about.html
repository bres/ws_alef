            <p class="text-md lg:text-lg leading-relaxed tracking-wide mt-2">
                ALEF brand was born in July of 2020, during a difficult season of humanity, from Krisana Alefantinou.<br>
                We felt that through the insecurity and fear that was all around us at the time,
                we needed to place our focus in regeneration and consequently in creation.<br>
                Krisana studied Industrial Design and Theatre in Greece.<br>
                Those two paths and her insurmountable need to create, led her to design women’s bags with minimal design.
